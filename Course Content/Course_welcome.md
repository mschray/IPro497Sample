During our first class we will be forming temporary teams to brainstorm project ideas for this course.  In previous editions on this course we had had projects (web or apps) like:

- Student marketplace (buy and sells books and goods like desks)
- Student Book marketplace (buy and sell books)
- Campus laundry signup and notifications
- Collaborative student job search portal
- Pokemon character lookup and capabilities 
- Movie recommenders

My ask of you for this week's class is bringing or brainstorming some new ideas for projects for this quarter.  In this course we have a process for allowing students to generate ideas and form teams around ideas they find interesting.

Regards
Martin
