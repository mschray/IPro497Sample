# Project Ideas
## Sponsored Projects
- The Office of Sponsored Research and Programs ("OSRP") submits all proposal and accepts all awards on behalf of Illinois Tech. Additionally, OSRP is responsible for all non-financial post-award issues such as re-budgeting and progress reports.
OSRP has 2 projects in mind.
1.	OSRP is looking for a way to manage non-financial post-award requests (ticketing system), combined with a way for principal investigators to engage in self-help. 
2.	We need a database to help us prepare current and pending support ("CPS") for proposals. This is our most time consuming task, and our grants management system, Cayuse, does not collect all of the date we need for the CPS. We need to pull some data from Cayuse, and we need a place to add additional data needed for CPS, and the system need to be able to be updated with changing statuses from Cayuse. 

```Additional context: OSRP is open to ideas, but given IIT's budgetary situation we should use tools that are currently available to IIT (i.e., Google suite and MS 365).```
